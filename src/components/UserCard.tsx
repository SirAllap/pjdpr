						My name is David Pallar√©s, and I live in the beautiful
						Canary Islands, where the sun shines all year round. For
						the past two years, I have been fully immersed in
						learning and creating, contributing to several
						noteworthy projects along the way. My interest in
						technology began in my childhood, where I spent
						countless hours tinkering with old gadgets, eager to
						understand their inner workings.

						After completing my education, I delved even further
						into the world of PCs and hardware, honing my skills in
						the art of crafting custom computers. The world of Linux
						and systems fascinated me, and I relished the joy of
						bringing together PC parts and giving them life.

						Just before the COVID pandemic, I discovered my true
						passion for web development. I enrolled in a web
						development course and dived straight into HTML, CSS,
						JS, and some PHP & Laravel. Although it wasn't a
						profound commitment at the time, it marked the beginning
						of a turning point for me.

						Two years ago, I made a bold decision to enroll in a
						Coding Bootcamp, where I gained an in-depth foundation
						in JS, Node, Express, UX-UI, Vue, React, which has been
						a game-changer for me. Since then, my commitment to
						learning and my curiosity about this fascinating world
						has only deepened. I have contributed to various
						remarkable projects, and I am eager to take on more
						challenges that will enhance my skills and expertise.
